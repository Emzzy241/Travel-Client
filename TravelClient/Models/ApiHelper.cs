            EXPLAINING THE METHOD
                When writing a client for an api, both the APi and the client should be up and running n different ports; thats a a configuration we did in our launchSettings.json file to avoid errors
                Your API call should include the port that TravelApi is set to listen to. We already did those configs in our launchSettings.json file
                If you do choose to deploy the project, you will need to update the URL to include the domain of the deployed site instead of localhost. The endpoint itself for this particular call will be api/destinations.
                
                Previously we used the ExecuteAsync() method when making api calls, now we are using GetAsync() the only advantage of GetAsync() for this is that it will throw an error if the server returns an error to us. This is important if we want to create a robust frontend applicaion,
                We'll also be using PutAsync(), PostAsync(), DeletAsync()

            EXPLAINING THE POST
                        The arguments passed into the RestRequest() method specify the route and method that should be passed into the API controller.
                        When making a POST request to our API (or any request that will be modifying our database), we need to add a header and a body. This way, our API can recognize the data types it receives and pass in the right argument for the controller route parameter(s).
                        We're also using the PostAsync() method, which will throw on a server error
